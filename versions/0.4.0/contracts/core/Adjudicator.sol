// @title Adjudicator: Fraud Proofs
// @notice We have three contracts.
// - Relay: Used by the relayer to submit responses.
//   It inherits the DataRegistry to manage temporarily storage of records.
// - Adjudicators: Accepts receipts (relay transactions signed by the relayer) and handles the customer's dispute process.
//   If the relayer fails to provide a quality of service, then it must compensate the customer in a timely manner.
// - LockableDeposit: Holds the relayer's security deposit. It will look up the adjudicator to determine
//   if the deposit should be locked or released to the relayer.
// The contracts ensure that our relayers are financially accountable and
// that evidence/logs are automatically produced for later use.
// @dev Dependency on the DataRegistry and Relayer contract
